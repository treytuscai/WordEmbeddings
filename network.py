        This involves performing the following tasks:
        1. Storing instance vars for the loss function and optimizer that will be used when training.
        2. Initializing the optimizer.
        3. Doing a "pilot run" forward pass with a single fake data sample that has the same shape as those that will be
        used when training. This will trigger each weight layer's lazy initialization to initialize weights, biases, and
        any other parameters.
        4. (Optional) Print a summary of the network architecture (layers + shapes) now that we have initialized all the
        layer parameters and know what the shapes will be.
        5. Get references to all the trainable parameters (e.g. wts, biases) from all network layers. This list will be
        used during backpropogation to efficiently update all the network parameters.

        0. To properly handle Dropout layers in your network, set the mode of all layers in the network to train mode
        before the training loop begins.

        in CS343 for sampling the dataset randomly WITH replacement.
            NOTE: I suggest using NumPy to create a RNG (before the training loop) with a fixed random seed to
            generate mini-batch indices. That way you can ensure that differing results you get across training runs are
            not just due to your random choice of samples in mini-batches. This should probably be your ONLY use of
            NumPy in `DeepNetwork`.
        2. Call `train_step` to handle the forward and backward pass on the mini-batch.
        3. Average and record training loss values across all mini-batches in each epoch (i.e. one avg per epoch).
        4. If we are at the end of an appropriate epoch (determined by `val_every`):
            - Check and record the acc/loss on the validation set.
            - Print out: current epoch, training loss, val loss, val acc
        5. Regardless of `val_every`, print out the current epoch number (and the total number). Use the time module to

        same line to reduce clutter.

        NOTE:
        - The provided `evaluate` method (below) should be useful for computing the validation acc+loss ;)
        - `evaluate` kicks all the network layers out of training mode (as is required bc it is doing prediction).

        -----------

        batch_sz: int.
            The batch size used to process the provided dataset. Larger numbers will generally execute faster, but
            all samples (and activations they create in the net) in the batch need to be maintained in memory at a time,
            which can result in crashes/strange behavior due to running out of memory.
            The default batch size should work fine throughout the semester and its unlikely you will need to change it.

        --------

            The accuracy.

        '''Helper method used during training to determine whether training should stop before the maximum number of
        training epochs is reached based on the most recent loss values computed on the validation set
        (`recent_val_losses`) the validation loss on the current epoch (`curr_val_loss`) and `patience`.

        (Week 2)

        - When training begins, the recent history of validation loss values `recent_val_losses` is empty (i.e. `[]`).
        When we have fewer entries in `recent_val_losses` than the `patience`, then we just insert the current val loss.
        - The length of `recent_val_losses` should not exceed `patience` (only the most recent `patience` loss values
        are considered).
        - The recent history of validation loss values (`recent_val_losses`) is assumed to be a "rolling list" or queue.
        Remove the oldest loss value and insert the current validation loss into the list. You may keep track of the
        full history of validation loss values during training, but maintain a separate list in `fit()` for this.

        Conditions that determine whether to stop training early:
        - We never stop early when the number of validation loss values in the recent history list is less than patience
        (training is just starting out).
        - We stop early when the OLDEST rolling validation loss (`curr_val_loss`) is smaller than all recent validation
        loss values. IMPORTANT: Assume that `curr_val_loss` IS one of the recent loss values â€” so the oldest loss value
        should be compared with `patience`-1 other more recent loss values.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        recent_val_losses: Python list of floats. len between 0 and `patience` (inclusive).
            Recently computed losses on the validation set.
        curr_val_loss: float
            The loss computed on the validation set on the current training epoch.
        patience: int.
            The patience: how many recent loss values computed on the validation set we should consider when deciding
            whether to stop training early.

        Returns:
        -----------
        recent_val_losses: Python list of floats. len between 1 and `patience` (inclusive).
            The list of recent validation loss values passsed into this method updated to include the current validation
            loss.
        stop. bool.
            Should we stop training based on the recent validation loss values and the patience value?

        NOTE:
        - This method can be concisely implemented entirely with regular Python (TensorFlow/Numpy not needed).
        - It may be helpful to think of `recent_val_losses` as a queue: the current loss value always gets inserted
        either at the beginning or end. The oldest value is then always on the other end of the list.
