class DenseEmbedding(layers.Dense):
    '''A DenseEmbedding layer, which is just like a regular Dense layer, except it interprets each mini-batch as
    a collection of INDICES to select or pull out rows of the Dense weight matrix. These extracted rows extracted from
    the weight matrix are net_in/net_act (after adding the bias).

        Parameters:
        -----------
        name: str.
            Human-readable name for the current layer (e.g. Drop_0). Used for debugging and printing summary of net.
        units. int.
            The number of neurons in the layer H.
        prev_layer_or_block: Layer (or Layer-like) object.
            Reference to the Layer object that is beneath the current Layer object. `None` if there is no preceding
            layer.

        You should only need to call and pass in relevant information into the superclass constructor to implement this
        method.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        x: tf.constant. tf.int32s. shape=(B,).
            Mini-batch of indices of weights to extract for the net input computation.
            NOTE: On 1st compile forward pass, the shape is actually (1, M) to make sure the weights get initialized
            correctly.

        Returns:
        --------
        tf.constant. tf.float32s. shape=(B, H).
            The net_in.

        NOTE: Don't forget the bias!
