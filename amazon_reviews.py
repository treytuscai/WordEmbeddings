def tokenize_words(text):
    '''Transforms a string sentence into words. Replaces contractions with same word without the apostrophe.

    This method is pre-filled for you (shouldn't require modification).

    Parameters:
    -----------
    text: string. Sentence of text.

    -----------
    list of strings. Words in the sentence `text`.

def make_corpus(N_reviews, min_sent_size=2, max_sent_len=30, verbose=False):
    '''Make the text corpus of the Amazon Fashion Reviews dataset.

    Transforms text documents (list of strings) into a list of list of words (both Python lists).
    The format is [[<sentence>], [<sentence>], ...], where <sentence> = [<word>, <word>, ...].

    For the Amazon data, this transforms a list of reviews (each is a single string) into a list of
    sentences, where each sentence is represented as a list of string words. So the elements of the
    resulting list are the i-th sentence overall. Because we lose information about which review the
    sentence comes from, we maintain a separate list that keeps track of the review number (index) from
    which the current sentence originates.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    N_reviews: int.
        Number of reviews to load from the file.
    min_sent_size: int.
        Don't add sentences LESS THAN this number of words to the corpus (skip over them). This is important because it
        removes empty sentences (bad parsing) and those with not enough word context.
    max_sent_len: int.
        If a sentence is equal or longer than this length, we trim the sentence down so it is `max_sent_len` words long
        before adding it to the corpus. This is important because it prevents the content of a very long from dominating
        the corpus.
    verbose: bool.
        If False, turn off all debug print outs.

    Returns:
    -----------
    Python list of str.
        The corpus represented as: [[<sentence>], [<sentence>], ...], where <sentence> = [<word>, <word>, ...].
    ndarray of np.float32.
        The star rating of the review associated with each sentence in the corpus.
        Example: 1st review is 3.5 stars and has 3 sentences. The ratings returned would be: [3.5, 3.5, 3.5, ...].
    ndarray of np.int32.
        The review ID associated with each sentence in the corpus.
        Example: 1st review is 3.5 stars and has 3 sentences. The review IDs returned would be: [0, 0, 0, ...].

    TODO:
    1. Load in the requested number of reviews and ratings.
    2. Split each review into sentences based on periods.
    3. Tokenize the sentence into individual word strings (via provided tokenize_words function).
    4. Make sure only sentences get added to the corpus that are above the min length and prune sentences that are too
    long.

    Parameters:

def make_ind2word_mapping(vocab):

    Indices for each word are in the range [0, vocab_sz-1].

    Parameters:
    -----------
    vocab: Python list of str.
        Unique words in corpus.

    Returns:
    -----------

def make_target_context_word_lists(corpus, word2ind, context_win_sz=2):
    '''Make the target word array ("classes") and context word array ("training samples").

    Parameters:
    -----------
    corpus: Python list of lists of str.
        List of sentences, each of which is a list of words (str).
    word2ind: Dictionary.
        Maps word string -> int code index. Range is [0, vocab_sz-1] inclusive.
    context_win_sz: int.
        How many words to include before/after the target word in sentences for context.

    Returns:
    --------
    tf.constant. tf.int32s. shape=(N,).
        The int-coded target words in the corpus,
    tf.constant. tf.int32s. shape=(N,).
        The int-coded context words.

    Each pair of target and context words occupy the i-th position of the target and context word lists that this
    function builds up. This means that there will likely be chains/sequences of repeating target words (when a target
    word has multiple context words in the context window, which is usually the case).

    Example:
    --------
    corpus = [['neural', 'nets', 'are', 'fun'], ...]
    word2ind: 'neural':0, 'nets':1, 'are':2, 'fun':3
    context_win_sz=1
    Then we will have:
    target_words_int =  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
    context_words_int = [1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2]

    NOTE:
    - As the example above illustrates, the number of context words in the window is NOT constant because of sentence
    edge effects.
    - The length of target_words_int and context_words_int MUST be equal!
